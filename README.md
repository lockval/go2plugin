# go2plugin

This is the intermediate package needed to write Go "scripts".

Go "Script" is the same concept as JS,Lua,Starlark in Lockval Engine. But it will be compiled into go plugin and added to api. It has native Go performance compared to other languages.

Aslo it is the reason of the Go plugin, there is no need to use this [api.so](https://github.com/lockval/api.so) solution to add function support
